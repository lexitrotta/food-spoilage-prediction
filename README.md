Food Spoilage Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis
End-to-end modeling of food spoilage using classification, regression, and survival analysis to predict remaining shelf-life. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering (environmental, chemical, and operational variables), survival modeling for “time until spoilage,” and evaluation using accuracy, MAE, RMSE, and C-index. Demonstrates how predictive models can support quality control and shelf-life decision making in food science and manufacturing.
